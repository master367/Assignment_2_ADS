Java Data Structures
This repository contains Java implementations of custom data structures.

Overview
The implemented data structures include:

MyArrayList: A dynamic array implementation supporting basic operations such as adding, removing, and sorting elements.
MyLinkedList: A singly linked list implementation offering operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements.
MyStack: A stack implementation using an underlying arraylist.
MyQueue: A queue implementation using an underlying linkedlist.
MyMinHeap: A min-heap implementation supporting operations for maintaining and interacting with the heap.
Each data structure is implemented to be generic, allowing a wide range of element types to be used.
